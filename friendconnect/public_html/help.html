      <h2>How to Use FriendConnect</h2>

      <h3>Logging In</h3>

      <div class="in">Unless you've got an account created, you'll need to register
        a new one with
        FriendConnect! To do so, all fields under the <i>Create Account</i> section
        must be filled out. Additionally, the email address you provide must be
        in the following format: somestring@somestring.somestring! Accounts already
        associated with an email address cannot have another account associated with
        them! A log in session = 60 minutes! Another thing to note: by default, account
        creation makes your account PUBLIC.</div>

      <h3>Side Bars & Main Page</h3>

      <div class="in">Once on the home page, there are 3 sections: the left side contains
        several
        buttons allowing for navigation across the site, the main portion contains the
        current information you are viewing (posts, users, groups, etc.); default is
        posts, and the right side contains information concerning your friends, the
        groups you are in, and pending friend requests for you to accept/decline.</div>

      <h3>Making Friends</h3>

      <div class="in">The whole point of FriendConnect is to make new friends/meet new users!
        If you want to make friends or view other users on this site, click the <i>View Other
        Profiles</i> on the home page. This should lead you to a page where you can
        view other people's profiles, read their bios, and send, accept, and decline
        friend requests! Additionally, once you're friends with someone, you can unfriend
        them as well (if you so choose).</div>

      <h3>Posts & Comments</h3>

      <div class="in">Once you're on the home page, it may seem pretty blank if you've got no
        friends
        making posts yet; however, to make a new post, click the <i>Make a New Post</i> button,
        which should redirect you to an interface that allows you to make a new text-based post.
        When you make a new post, it should redirect you to your feed and the post should be
        there! To comment on a post, simply click <i>Comment</i> and that should redirect you
        to another page where you can write your comment! Main posts can be edited, liked, and
        unliked as well! The default home page/feed includes posts visible to you (so your posts
        and the posts of your friends)!</div>

      <h3>Groups</h3>

      <div class="in">Alongside making friends, you can also create groups! To make a new group,
        simply click the <i>Make a New Group</i> button, which should redirect you to an interface
        that allows you to create a new group with a name and a brief bio that describes
        what the group is about. To view other groups, you can click to <i>View Groups</i>
        button. Here, you are taken to a page where you can view other groups, their bios, and
        decide whether or not you'd like to join/leave groups!</div>

      <h3>Edit Profile</h3>

      <div class="in">Unhappy with some of the information you entered? Or would you like to
        update your bio or privacy settings? Click the <i>Edit Profile</i> button on
        the home page. Here, you can modify your first and last name, your bio
        that is potentially displayed to other users! Additionally, you have the
        ability to make your account Public or Private (a private account hides your
        bio from other users)! You can also add/update your profile picture here to
        show other users who you are!</div>

      <h3>Logging Out</h3>

      <div class="in">Ready to log out? Click the <i>LOGOUT</i> button on the upper right corner
        of the page and your current session should end!</div>

      <!-- Return back button for the user to click to go back to app -->
      <div><input class="homeBut" onclick="returnHome();" type="button" value="Return Back"
        /></div>

    </div>
